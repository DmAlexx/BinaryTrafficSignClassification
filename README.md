1. Use the data from data/subset_homework folder and visualize some examples. How many images are there for each class?
   - class 0 (sign 30) - 2220
   - class 1 (sign 50) - 2250

Step 2
Run the training with one single neuron (as we did in the lecture). What accuracy can you achieve?
- Accuracy 0.9044742729306487

Step 3
Make further modifications to improve the accuracy (e.g. add more neurons, more layers, etc.). What is the maximum accuracy you can achieve?
- I've tried some different combination and numbers of neurons in two layers and activation function, but better tnan Accuracy ~ 0.94 I didn't recieve. And it was
- in 2 neurons (linear function) in first dense and 1 neurons (relu function) in second. Other increasing of neurons and layers show me worse results.
